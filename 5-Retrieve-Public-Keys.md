# Retrieve Public Keys

## Kleopatra

In this step we are going to retrieve the public key from the key pair that was just created. By doing this we are able to make the public key available to those that wish to communicate with you securely. Without it, they will not be able to encrypt messages that you are able to decrypt.

1. In the &quot;My Certificates&quot; tab, right click on your key and click &quot;Export Certificates…&quot;

1. Browse to the location where you want to save the public key and click &quot;Save&quot; (Note: you may want to give it a name that distinguishes this file as your public key)
2. The public key can be viewed in a text editor, like notepad. Browse to the location where you saved the key and open it. (Note: The key will have a &quot;.asc&quot; extension, you may have to select &quot;All files&quot; from the dropdown menu.

1. The text you see in the file is your public key. This is the text that you will send to others so they can import it into their PGP application.
